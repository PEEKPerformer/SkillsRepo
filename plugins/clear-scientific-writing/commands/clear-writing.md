description: Edit and improve scientific writing by eliminating vague significance-language, formulaic structures, and abstract vocabulary. Use when reviewing papers, abstracts, methods sections, or technical documents. Transforms generic claims into specific, substantive content.

# Clear Scientific Writing

Edit scientific text to replace verbal gestures with actual content. The fundamental problem: weak writing substitutes claims of significance for actual information.

## Core Principle

When writing claims something is "important" or "significant" or "novel"—ask: *What specifically was found? What specifically makes it matter?* Write that instead.

**Weak:** "This finding serves as a testament to the pivotal role that microstructure plays in determining properties."

**Better:** "The double-peak behavior disappears when pore size exceeds 200 μm, suggesting the peaks require walls thin enough to buckle elastically."

## Editing Checklist

1. **Delete inflating language** - "crucial," "pivotal," "novel," "significant" usually add nothing
2. **Cut trailing "-ing" phrases** - "...highlighting the importance of" can almost always be deleted
3. **Replace vague attribution** - "Studies have shown" → cite specific papers
4. **Add specifics** - numbers, conditions, comparisons to prior work
5. **Verify claims** - if a citation exists, does it actually support the claim?

## Reference Files

Consult these for detailed patterns and examples:

| File | Content |
|------|---------|
| `references/CONTENT_PROBLEMS.md` | Inflating importance, superficial analysis, vague attribution |
| `references/LANGUAGE_PROBLEMS.md` | Overused words, weak transitions, hedging |
| `references/STRUCTURAL_PROBLEMS.md` | Formatting, em dashes, false ranges |
| `references/CITATION_PROBLEMS.md` | Citation clusters, padding, unsupported claims |
| `references/FORMULAS.md` | Generic intro/methods/discussion/conclusion patterns |
| `references/FALSE_GOOD_WRITING.md` | Things that sound analytical but aren't |
| `references/SELF_DIAGNOSIS.md` | Questions to ask your draft |

## Quick Reference: Words to Question

| Word | Problem |
|------|---------|
| novel | Often claimed, rarely demonstrated |
| crucial/vital/pivotal/key | Inflates without justification |
| underscore/highlight | Inanimate things can't underscore |
| intricate/intricacies | Vague gesture at complexity |
| interplay | Vague gesture at interaction |
| landscape/tapestry | Metaphorical fluff |
| delve/elucidate | Often pretentious |

## The Read-Aloud Test

Read the text aloud. If a sentence makes you feel slightly embarrassed, it's probably empty rhetoric. "This work showcases the intricate interplay between structure and properties, highlighting the crucial role of composition in fostering enhanced performance." Would you actually say that to a colleague?
