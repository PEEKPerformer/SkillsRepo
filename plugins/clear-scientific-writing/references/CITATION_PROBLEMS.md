# Citation Problems

## Citation Clusters Without Support

Weak writing clusters citations at paragraph ends without connecting them to specific claims.

### Example

**Weak:** "Graphene has excellent electrical conductivity and mechanical strength. It has been used in sensors, electrodes, and composites. The properties depend on layer number and defect density [1-17]."

Which of those 17 papers supports which claim? A reader wanting to verify the conductivity claim has to check all 17.

**Better:** "Graphene's conductivity (~10⁶ S/m for pristine monolayers) exceeds copper [1], though defects reduce this substantially—by 90% for heavily oxidized graphene [2,3]. Few-layer graphene (3-10 layers) offers a practical balance between conductivity and processability [4]."

Each claim has its own citation(s).

## References That Don't Support Claims

A subtler problem: citations that exist and are real papers, but don't actually support the claim they're attached to.

**Example:** "The piezoresistive mechanism involves tunneling between adjacent graphene sheets [12]."

Reference 12 might be a paper that mentions tunneling once in the introduction while actually studying something else entirely. Or it might be about tunneling in a completely different material system.

**Rule:** When you cite a paper for a specific claim, verify that the paper actually makes or supports that claim. If you're citing for general background, distinguish that from citing for specific evidence.

## Padding with Unnecessary Citations

Weak writing adds citations to signal scholarship rather than to support claims.

**Weak:** "Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is a widely used characterization technique in materials science [8-15]. We used SEM to image our samples."

You don't need citations for common knowledge or standard techniques.

### Save Citations For

- Specific claims that could be disputed
- Methods that aren't standard (and need justification)
- Comparisons to prior work
- Context readers might want to explore further
