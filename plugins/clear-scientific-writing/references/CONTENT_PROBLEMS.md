## Inflating Importance

Weak writing puffs up findings with grand claims about significance, legacy, and broader implications.

### Phrases to Eliminate

- plays a vital/significant/crucial/pivotal role
- stands as / serves as a testament to
- underscores/highlights the importance/significance of
- reflects broader trends in
- marks a pivotal moment / key turning point
- demonstrates the profound impact
- indelible mark / enduring legacy
- deeply rooted in

### Example

**Weak:** "This finding serves as a testament to the pivotal role that microstructure plays in determining the functional properties of composite materials, underscoring the importance of continued investigation into structure-property relationships."

**Better:** "The double-peak behavior disappears when pore size exceeds 200 μm, suggesting the peaks require walls thin enough to buckle elastically before collapsing."

The first sentence claims importance. The second sentence *is* important—it tells you something specific and useful.

### The Biology Variant

When discussing environment or ecology, weak writing overemphasizes ecosystem connections and conservation implications:

**Weak:** "This species plays a vital role in the ecosystem and its preservation is crucial for maintaining biodiversity."

What role? Which ecosystem? What conservation efforts?

**Better:** "This species pollinates three native orchids found nowhere else. It has not been formally assessed by IUCN, and no targeted conservation programs exist."

## Superficial Analysis

Weak writing attaches analytical-sounding statements to facts using trailing "-ing" phrases.

### Constructions to Watch

- [fact], reflecting the broader importance of...
- [fact], demonstrating the crucial role of...
- [fact], highlighting the need for...
- [fact], underscoring the significance of...
- [fact], contributing to our understanding of...
- [fact], providing valuable insights into...

### Example

**Weak:** "The conductivity decreased by 40% after 100 cycles, highlighting the importance of understanding degradation mechanisms in flexible electronics."

The "-ing" phrase adds nothing. Delete it:

**Better:** "Conductivity decreased by 40% after 100 cycles."

If you want to analyze, actually analyze:

**Actual analysis:** "Conductivity decreased by 40% after 100 cycles—too fast for structural health monitoring applications, which require years of stability, but potentially acceptable for disposable medical sensors used once and discarded."

**Test:** Can you delete the "-ing" phrase without losing information? If yes, delete it.

## Vague Attribution

Weak writing attributes claims to unnamed authorities.

### Phrases to Eliminate

- Experts argue / Researchers suggest
- Studies have shown / Research indicates
- It is widely accepted / It is well established
- Industry reports suggest
- Observers have noted

### Example

**Weak:** "Researchers have suggested that graphene composites offer superior performance compared to traditional materials, and experts argue that this technology has significant potential for various applications."

**Better:** "Chen et al. (2019) reported 10× higher gauge factors in graphene composites than in carbon black composites at equivalent loadings."

Or for consensus:

**Better:** "Graphene composites consistently show higher gauge factors than carbon black composites at equivalent filler loadings (Chen 2019, Park 2020, Williams 2021)."

### The "Has Been Described As" Problem

**Weak:** "The mechanism has been described as involving synergistic interactions between the filler and matrix."

Described by whom? This often means "I think" disguised as external validation. If it's your interpretation, own it: "We propose that synergistic interactions between filler and matrix explain the enhanced response."

## The Challenges-and-Future-Prospects Formula

Weak writing follows a rigid template: praise, acknowledge challenges with "Despite its [positive qualities]...", end with vague optimism.

### The Formula

> Despite its [impressive property], [subject] faces challenges including [list of problems]. Despite these challenges, [subject] continues to [vague positive verb] and future work will [vague aspiration].

### Example

**Weak:** "Despite its high sensitivity, the graphene foam sensor faces challenges including limited cycle stability and temperature sensitivity. Despite these challenges, the material continues to show promise for wearable electronics, and ongoing research may address these limitations through innovative approaches to material design."

**Better:** "The sensor's gauge factor degrades 40% over 100 cycles, likely due to irreversible pore collapse. For applications requiring >1000 cycles, the foam would need reinforcement—perhaps by coating pore walls with rigid polymer, though this might reduce sensitivity. Temperature sensitivity (±15% from 20-40°C) probably reflects thermal expansion mismatch between graphene and silicone; a lower-expansion matrix might help."

### The "Future Work" Trail-Off

**Weak:** "Future work should investigate additional parameters and explore alternative approaches. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

If you have specific next steps, state them: "Next steps should include in-situ electron microscopy during compression to directly observe pore collapse, and testing foams with reinforced pore walls."

If you don't have specific ideas, just end after your conclusions.
