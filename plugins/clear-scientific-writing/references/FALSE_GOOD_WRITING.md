# Things That Seem Like Good Writing But Aren't

## Sounding Analytical

Phrases like "this highlights," "this underscores," "this demonstrates the importance of" sound analytical without being analytical. They're claims about what readers should conclude rather than evidence or reasoning.

### Example

**Pseudo-analysis:** "The temperature dependence of conductivity demonstrates the importance of thermal management in practical applications."

**Actual analysis:** "Conductivity drops 30% from 25°C to 40°C. For on-body sensors, where skin temperature varies from 32-36°C, this would cause resistance fluctuations of ~15%, comparable to the signal from 5% strain—making temperature compensation essential."

The second version explains *why* thermal management matters, with numbers, for a specific application.

## Sounding Thorough

Listing many factors without analyzing any of them isn't thoroughness.

### Example

**Pseudo-thorough:** "The piezoresistive response depends on many factors including graphene loading, aspect ratio, dispersion state, matrix modulus, foam density, pore size, pore connectivity, strain rate, temperature, humidity, and cycling history."

This signals the author knows variables exist. It provides no useful information about how these variables affect the response or which ones dominate.

**Actually thorough:** "Of the variables we tested, graphene loading had the largest effect (gauge factor increased 6× from 0.5 wt% to 5 wt%), followed by pore size (3× effect across the range tested). Strain rate had negligible effect below 10%/s. We did not systematically vary other factors."

## Sounding Balanced

The "not only X but also Y" construction can balance considerations, but it's often used to make simple claims sound sophisticated.

### Example

**Pseudo-balanced:** "The results are not only relevant to fundamental understanding of piezoresistive mechanisms but also have significant implications for practical sensor development."

This says nothing. Of course a paper on piezoresistive sensors is relevant to both mechanisms and applications. The construction adds words without adding meaning.

## Sounding Cautious

Excessive hedging doesn't make writing more rigorous; it makes writing evasive.

### Example

**Pseudo-cautious:** "It could perhaps be tentatively suggested that the data may be somewhat consistent with the possibility that pore wall buckling might potentially contribute, to some degree, to the observed behavior."

**Actually cautious:** "The data suggest pore wall buckling contributes to the first resistance peak, though we cannot exclude other mechanisms. Direct imaging during compression would provide stronger evidence."

The second version acknowledges specific uncertainty (other mechanisms possible, direct imaging would help) rather than piling up words that signal uncertainty without specifying what's uncertain.
