## The Generic Introduction

Weak introductions follow a template:

1. Grand claim about the field's importance
2. "In recent years, X has attracted considerable attention"
3. List of prior work without synthesis
4. "However, [gap] remains poorly understood"
5. "Here we report..."

### Example

**Weak:** "Flexible electronics represent a rapidly growing field with important applications in healthcare, robotics, and consumer devices [1-5]. In recent years, graphene-based composites have attracted considerable attention due to their unique combination of electrical and mechanical properties [6-12]. Various studies have investigated piezoresistive behavior [13], strain sensing [14], and flexible conductors [15]. However, the mechanisms governing piezoresistive response in foamed structures remain poorly understood. Here we report a systematic study of piezoresistive behavior in graphene-silicone foams."

This could open hundreds of papers. It says nothing specific about what this paper contributes.

**Better:** "Piezoresistive strain sensors convert deformation to electrical signal. Nearly all reported piezoresistive composites show monotonic response—resistance increases with strain until fracture. Here we report an exception: graphene-silicone foams that exhibit two distinct resistance peaks during compression, at 15% and 40% strain. We attribute the peaks to sequential deformation mechanisms—elastic buckling followed by plastic collapse—supported by in-situ electron microscopy."

This version says exactly what's new, how it differs from prior work, and what explains it.

## The Generic Methods

Weak methods use vague language that prevents replication.

**Weak:** "Samples were prepared using standard techniques. Materials were purchased from commercial suppliers. Various characterization methods were employed."

### What to Specify

- Exact materials (supplier, grade, catalog number)
- Quantities (masses, volumes, concentrations)
- Conditions (temperature, time, atmosphere)
- Equipment (model, settings)
- Number of replicates and how variability was assessed

## The Restating Discussion

Weak discussions begin by restating everything from Results.

**Weak:** "In this study, we investigated piezoresistive behavior in graphene-silicone foams. We found that resistance showed double-peak behavior during compression. The first peak occurred at 15% strain and the second at 40% strain. The gauge factor was 12.3. Higher graphene loading increased sensitivity."

This is redundant. Discussion should interpret results, not repeat them.

**Better:** "The double-peak response we observe has not been reported in any piezoresistive composite to our knowledge. We propose this behavior arises from two sequential deformation modes..."

Start with interpretation.

## The Summary Conclusion

Weak conclusions summarize rather than conclude.

**Weak:** "In conclusion, we fabricated graphene-silicone foams and characterized their piezoresistive properties. We found double-peak behavior with a gauge factor of 12.3. The material shows promise for flexible sensors. Future work should explore additional compositions and investigate underlying mechanisms."

**Better:** "Graphene-silicone foams exhibit piezoresistive behavior unlike conventional composites: two resistance peaks arising from buckling and collapse of pore walls. This mechanism suggests a design principle: hierarchical structures with multiple deformation modes can produce complex, tunable sensor responses. Testing this principle will require foams with controlled pore architecture—bimodal pore size distributions or gradient structures."

The first version restates. The second draws a general principle and identifies what's needed to explore it.
