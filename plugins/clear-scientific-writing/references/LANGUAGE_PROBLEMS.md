# Language Problems

## Overused Abstract Vocabulary

Certain words appear constantly in weak writing. Their concentration signals the writer is performing substance rather than providing it.

### High-Frequency Offenders

| Word | Problem |
|------|---------|
| novel | Often claimed, rarely demonstrated |
| crucial / vital / pivotal / key | Inflates importance without justification |
| intricate / intricacies | Vague gesture at complexity |
| underscore / highlight (as verbs) | Inanimate things can't underscore or highlight |
| foster / garner | Unnecessarily fancy synonyms |
| enhance | Often used without saying how much or in what way |
| landscape (metaphorical) | "The landscape of flexible electronics" |
| tapestry (metaphorical) | "The rich tapestry of structure-property relationships" |
| interplay | Vague gesture at interaction without specifying mechanism |
| showcase | Promotional language |
| leverage | Business jargon |
| delve | "Delve into the mechanisms" |
| elucidate | Often pretentious |

### Example

**Weak:** "This work showcases the intricate interplay between microstructure and electrical properties, highlighting the crucial role of pore architecture in fostering enhanced piezoresistive response and underscoring the need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms."

**Better:** "Pore size controls the piezoresistive response: foams with 50 μm pores show gauge factors of 12, while foams with 200 μm pores show gauge factors of 3. The smaller pores produce thinner walls that buckle more readily under strain."

### The Subject Test

Many of these words cause problems when their subjects are inanimate. A person can highlight something. A fact cannot. When you write "These results highlight the importance of...", you're editorializing about what readers should conclude. Make the editorializing explicit ("We interpret these results as evidence that...") or cut it.

## Weak Transitions

"Additionally" is a weak transition that often signals padding. It means "and here's another thing" without specifying logical relationship.

### Example

**Weak:** "The material showed high conductivity. Additionally, it exhibited good flexibility. Additionally, it was thermally stable."

**Better as list:** "The material was conductive, flexible, and thermally stable."

**Better with logic:** "Beyond conductivity, flexibility matters for wearable applications..." or "Thermal stability is also necessary because body temperature varies..."

### Other Weak Transitions

- Furthermore (slightly better than additionally, but often padding)
- Moreover (same)
- It is worth noting that (almost always cuttable)
- It is important to remember that (if it's important, you don't need to announce it)

## Negative Parallelisms

Constructions like "not only X but Y" can be effective but are overused:

**Weak:** "This is not just a measurement technique; it's a window into the fundamental physics governing charge transport in disordered systems."

**Weak:** "The findings are not only significant for understanding piezoresistive behavior, but also have important implications for the broader field of flexible electronics."

These constructions often bury the point. Say it directly:

**Better:** "The measurements reveal charge transport physics: hopping between graphene sheets dominates at low strain, while direct contact dominates at high strain."

## The Rule of Three

Grouping items in threes can be rhetorically effective, but weak writing overuses it:

**Weak:** "Graphene offers high conductivity, excellent mechanical strength, and superior flexibility. These properties make it suitable for sensors, actuators, and energy storage devices. We characterized the material using SEM, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy."

When every sentence has three items, the pattern becomes monotonous and signals the writer is filling space. Not everything comes in threes. If two examples suffice, use two. If four are necessary, use four.

## Elegant Variation

"Elegant variation" means swapping in synonyms to avoid repeating a word. In scientific writing, this backfires.

**Weak:** "The graphene composite showed high conductivity. The carbon-based material exhibited strain sensitivity. The hybrid structure demonstrated flexibility."

Readers may not realize these refer to the same thing. Call it "the graphene composite" throughout.

Especially problematic with technical terms. If you switch from "piezoresistive coefficient" to "strain sensitivity factor" to "electromechanical coupling parameter," readers will wonder if these are three different measurements.

## False Ranges

"From X to Y" constructions should describe a real scale with identifiable endpoints and middle ground.

### Valid Ranges

- "from 20°C to 80°C" (temperature scale)
- "from 1 Hz to 100 kHz" (frequency scale)
- "from brittle to ductile" (mechanical behavior scale)

### False Ranges

**False:** "From the intricate nanostructure to the bulk mechanical properties, this material offers insights spanning multiple length scales."

Problem: "intricate nanostructure" and "bulk mechanical properties" aren't endpoints on a single scale. There's no coherent middle ground.

**False:** "From fundamental physics to practical applications, this work bridges the gap between science and engineering."

What falls between these endpoints? Everything? Nothing specific?

**Fix:** List them as two things: "This work addresses both nanostructure and bulk properties."

---

## Hedging

Scientific writing requires hedging, but weak writing stacks hedges until sentences commit to nothing.

### Over-Hedged

"These results may possibly suggest that the mechanism could potentially involve some degree of pore wall buckling, which might contribute to the observed behavior under certain conditions."

### Appropriate Hedging

"The results suggest pore wall buckling contributes to the first resistance peak."

### How to Choose Hedges

One hedge is usually enough. Match your confidence:

- "X causes Y" — strong claim, direct evidence
- "X contributes to Y" — confident but acknowledging other factors
- "X is consistent with Y" — evidence supports but doesn't prove
- "X suggests Y" — moderate confidence, inferential
- "The data are consistent with X, though Y cannot be excluded" — explicitly acknowledging alternatives

Don't stack hedges. "May possibly suggest that X could potentially" doesn't communicate more uncertainty than "suggests X"—it just sounds evasive.
