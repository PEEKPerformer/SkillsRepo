# Self-Diagnosis

## Questions to Ask Your Draft

1. **Can I delete "important," "significant," "crucial," "novel" without losing information?** If yes, you're probably claiming significance rather than demonstrating it.

2. **What specific findings would remain if I stripped all adjectives?** If almost nothing, your draft is mostly claims about your findings rather than the findings themselves.

3. **Could my introduction describe hundreds of papers in my field?** If yes, it's not specific enough to your contribution.

4. **Can I delete all "-ing" phrases that follow commas without losing information?** Phrases like "demonstrating the importance of," "highlighting the need for," "contributing to our understanding of" are usually empty.

5. **Have I defined the relationship between every pair of consecutive paragraphs?** If paragraphs are just stacked without logical connection, the structure is weak.

6. **Could a reader reproduce my experiment from my Methods section?** If not, it's too vague.

7. **Does my Discussion add anything beyond restating Results?** If not, either the interpretation is missing or it belongs in Results.

8. **Does every citation support a specific claim?** Or are citations clustered as general gestures toward scholarship?

9. **Am I using three-item lists because I have three things to say, or because threes sound authoritative?**

10. **Would my claims sound absurd if I said them aloud to a colleague?** "This work showcases the intricate interplay between structure and properties, highlighting the crucial role of composition in fostering enhanced performance." Would you actually say that?

## The Read-Aloud Test

Read your paper aloud. Awkward sentences, empty phrases, and excessive hedging become obvious when you hear them. If you stumble, your readers will stumble too.

Pay attention to sentences that make you feel slightly embarrassed to read aloud. This usually signals empty rhetoric.

## The Core Fix

Bad writing substitutes gestures for content: gestures toward significance, gestures toward analysis, gestures toward balance and caution. These gestures have recognizable forms—the "-ing" phrase that claims importance, the "not only X but Y" that simulates balance, the hedge stack that simulates caution.

Recognizing these forms is the first step. But the real fix goes deeper: having something specific to say, and saying it directly.

When you find yourself reaching for "this underscores the importance of," stop and ask: *What specifically did I find? What specifically does it mean?*

Write that instead.
