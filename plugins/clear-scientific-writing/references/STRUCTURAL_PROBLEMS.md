# Structural Problems

## Title Case in Headings

Capitalizing Every Major Word in Headings looks like a press release or marketing document. In scientific writing, sentence case is standard.

**Avoid:** Effect of Graphene Loading on Piezoresistive Performance in Silicone Foam Composites

**Better:** Effect of graphene loading on piezoresistive performance in silicone foam composites

## Excessive Formatting

Weak writing overuses boldface, bullet points, and other formatting as if density of formatting signals density of content.

### Problems

- **Bolding key terms** throughout the text means **nothing stands out** because **everything is emphasized** equally.
- Bullet points for everything:
  - Convert connected prose
  - Into disconnected fragments
  - That lose logical relationships
  - And suggest the writer couldn't write paragraphs

### When to Use Bullets

- Actual lists (reagents, equipment, steps)
- Items with no logical ordering
- Reference material meant to be scanned, not read

### When Not to Use Bullets

- Arguments (which require logical connectives)
- Explanations (which require sentences to build on each other)
- Results (which need context and interpretation)

### The Inline-Header List

A particularly weak format:

**Weak:**
- **Conductivity:** The material showed high conductivity at all loadings.
- **Flexibility:** The foams could bend without cracking.
- **Stability:** Thermal stability was measured up to 150°C.

This format destroys logical connections. Prose does this better: "The material showed high conductivity at all loadings while remaining flexible enough to bend without cracking. Thermal stability extended to 150°C, sufficient for most wearable applications."

## Em Dashes

Em dashes (—) are useful for emphasis or interruption. Overuse creates breathless, fragmented prose.

**Weak:** "The piezoresistive effect—a change in electrical resistance under mechanical strain—is well established in graphene composites—particularly those with high aspect ratio fillers—though the mechanisms—especially in foamed structures—remain poorly understood—a gap this paper aims to address."

### Pick the Right Punctuation

- Commas for light pauses: "The piezoresistive effect, a change in resistance under strain, is well established"
- Parentheses for true asides: "The piezoresistive effect (change in resistance under strain) is well established"
- Em dashes for emphasis: "One mechanism—pore wall buckling—had not been considered before"

One or two em dashes per paragraph is plenty; more suggests the prose needs restructuring.
